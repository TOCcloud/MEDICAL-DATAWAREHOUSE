# MEDICAL-DATAWAREHOUSE
Building a dataware house for breast cancer data for easy visulaization and creation of predictive model
# Breast Cancer Data Warehouse Project

## üìå Overview
This project involves building a **data warehouse** for breast cancer datasets to enable advanced analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling.  
Our goal is to provide a **centralized, clean, and structured repository** of breast cancer data that can support:
- Research and data exploration
- Development of predictive models
- Interactive dashboards for insights
- Decision-making support for healthcare stakeholders

## üéØ Objectives
1. **Data Ingestion** ‚Äì Collect raw breast cancer data from multiple sources (e.g., CSV files, APIs, clinical records).
2. **Data Transformation** ‚Äì Clean, normalize, and enrich data for consistency and usability.
3. **Data Storage** ‚Äì Store processed data in a well-structured data warehouse for easy querying.
4. **Analytics & Visualization** ‚Äì Build dashboards that reveal patterns, trends, and correlations.
5. **Predictive Modeling** ‚Äì Train and evaluate machine learning models for cancer prediction and classification.
6. **Documentation & Reproducibility** ‚Äì Ensure all steps are well-documented for repeatability.

## üóÇ Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset:** Breast cancer datasets (e.g., [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset]
- **Additional Sources:** Any clinical or research data relevant to breast cancer.

> All datasets are stored securely and comply with relevant privacy and ethical standards.

## üèó Architecture
The project follows a **modern data pipeline** approach:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Scripts to pull data from CSV, APIs, or databases.
   - Batch and/or streaming ingestion methods.
   
2. **Staging Area**
   - Raw data stored without modification for reference.
   
3. **ETL / ELT Processing**
   - Data cleaning, handling missing values, formatting, and feature engineering.
   
4. **Data Warehouse**
   - Star schema or snowflake schema designed for analytics.
   - Tables organized by **fact** and **dimension**.

5. **Analytics Layer**
   - SQL queries for aggregations and transformations.
   
6. **Visualization & Modeling**
   - Dashboards using tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Apache Superset**.
   - Machine learning models developed with **Python** (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow).

## üìä Key Deliverables
- **Data Warehouse Schema** with ER diagrams.
- **ETL Scripts** for reproducible data loading.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** reports.
- **Interactive Dashboards** for breast cancer trends.
- **Predictive Models** for classification (benign vs malignant).
- **Project Documentation** for setup, usage, and maintenance.
